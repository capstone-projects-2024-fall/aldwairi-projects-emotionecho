# Emotion Echo

## Overview
Emotion Echo is an Android application designed to help users who may struggle to recognize 
emotions in speech. With the use of machine learning, this app analyzes audio to detect and display 
emotions in speech, assisting users in understanding emotional cues in their own or others' voices.
The application additionally allows users to practice recognizing emotion in pre-existing audio clips.
