# Emotion Echo

## Overview
Emotion Echo is an Android application designed to help users who may struggle to recognize 
emotions in speech. With the use of machine learning, this app analyzes audio to detect and display 
emotions in speech, assisting users in understanding emotional cues in their own or others' voices.
The application additionally allows users to practice recognizing emotion in pre-existing audio clips.
This project is currently in progress. 

There is an increasing need for learning how to understand emotional information from speech in conversations.
Emotion Echo provides an efficient way to detect emotion from audio recordings in real-time and present accurate
feedback for users. The app will also provide user features including
multiple microphone modes, account setup, and database they can use for practice.
