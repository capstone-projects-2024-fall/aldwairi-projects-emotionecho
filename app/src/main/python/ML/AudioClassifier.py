class AudioClassifier:
    """
    AudioClassifier class.

    Purpose: This class is responsible for classifying new audio inputs using our ML model.

    Attributes:
    - model: The pre-trained model.
    - audio_features: The preprocessed audio features we need to classify.

    Methods:
    - __init__(model): Constructor that initializes the classifier with the pre-trained model.
    - classify_audio(audio_features): Classifies the provided audio features and returns the predicted emotions.

        Constructor for AudioClassifier.

        Args:
            model (object): The pre-trained model to use for classification.

        Pre-condition: The model must be created and valid.
        Post-condition: An AudioClassifier instance is created with the given model.

        Pre-condition: The audio features must be preprocessed and fit into the model.
        Post-condition: The predicted emotion is returned as a string.

        Args:
            audio_features (list of float): A list of float values representing the preprocessed audio features.

        Returns:
            str: The predicted emotion/emotions.
